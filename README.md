# Game Library

## Introduction

This application is for those who wish to catalogue their game collection and track which games they have played,
beaten, or completed. This application is for anyone who wants to track their collection of video games, from casual
players to hardcore collectors.

## Why this?

I chose this project because it takes the base idea of a to-do list and makes it better suited for a collection of 
games. I also think that I would actually use this program in my own time, and enjoy programming practical applications 
that I would use in real life.

## Features

- the ability to add and remove games
- update game's status such as completion status or play time
- sort their list by completion status, system, playtime, or alphabetically
